Nica was introduced to anime at a very young age. Her interest in anime grew much more after high school graduation while waiting to start college and she had nothing else to do. She goes to Japan annually like some kind of ritual. Her favorite anime is Gintama.

He started out reading manga then transitioned to anime when his internet got better. Honey&amp;Clover, Ichigo 100%, Uzumaki, Golden Boy, Full Metal Alchemist, and Psycho-Pass are a few of his favorite mangas/ animes.
