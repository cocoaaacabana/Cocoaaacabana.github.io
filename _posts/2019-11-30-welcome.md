Hello there fellow anime fans! I welcome you to our new venture here at NicMiCo! Nica and I are proud 90's kids, when the internet was just at its youth.

Anime has changed since the 90s but themes, tropes, and cliches remain unchanged. It's entertaining to see these connections in the anime we see today. We'd like people to see these nuances as well as feature/mention some anime series that you probably haven't heard about. Knowing that they exist is half the battle! So everyone can enjoy them and, eventually, talk about them.
